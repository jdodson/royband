<h4>Lyrics</h4>

<p>
  Too many times I think<br>
  The next thing that i see<br>
  Will be all I’ll that i’ll ever need<br>
  The warm glow of screens<br>
  Escapism is pristine<br>
  I’d rather be anyone than me<br><br>

  If JJ Abrams rebooted the little Mermaid<br>
  Then Everything would be just fine<br>
  No one would ever starve<br>
  No one else in pain<br>
  We’d never have a bad day again<br>
  Never have a bad day<br><br>

  Let’s be honest for one<br>
  He’d give King Triton a gun<br>
  And the greatest time in America would ring true<br>
  The big mystery box<br>
  Ursula would be her Mom<br>
  And everyone in the world would be saved<br><br>

  If JJ Abrams rebooted the little Mermaid<br>
  Then Everything would be just fine<br>
  No one would ever starve<br>
  No one else in pain<br>
  We’d never have a bad day again<br>
  Never have a bad day<br>
  If JJ Abrams rebooted the little Mermaid<br>
  Then Everything would be just fine<br>
  No one would ever starve<br>
  No one else in pain<br>
  We’d never have a bad day again<br>
  Never have a bad day<br>
  Never have a bad day<br>
  Never have a bad day
</p>
