<h4>Lyrics</h4>

<p>
  When I was born I looked into the night sky<br>
  The stars in the cosmos looked so very oh oh strange a-ange<br>
  The cold night air blew against my Reptile skin uh in<br>
  A Lizard priest with my oh oh oh human memoree e ees<br><br>

  200G Illuminati Mind Control<br>
  200G Illuminati Mind Control<br><br>

  First the 3G came I said did not speak out<br>
  Then the 4G came and they took away my house<br>
  5G came there wasn’t enough tin foil to line my bowling lane<br>
  They skipped 6G towers and chipped directly in my brain<br><br>

  200G Illuminati Mind Control<br>
  200G Illuminati Mind Control<br><br>

  The Reptile people were nice, quiet and slow moving<br>
  But I realized quickly they had no idea where earth was<br>
  I tried describing the Milky Way of Earth my home<br>
  But I realized that I would forever be a human living as a Lizard Priest<br><br>

  200G Illuminati Mind Control<br>
  200G Illuminati Mind Control<br>
  200G Illuminati Mind Control<br>
  200G Illuminati Mind Control<br>
  200G<br>
