<h4>Lyrics</h4>

<p>
  Do you remember that time that we got into my Geo<br>
  We drove to Oregon to Washington in a day<br>
  We went to visit the grave of Jimi Hendrix<br>
  We paid our respects that day<br><br>

  And I believe in you and me<br>
  And we will always be<br>
  And I believe in you and me<br>
  And Roy will always be<br><br>

  I remember the show we rocked much a<br>
  While we played Rocket to Russia<br>
  Wearing your Cowboy Hat<br>
  I pointed to the sky in fact<br>
  And we brought the Rock and Roll<br><br>

  And I believe in you and me<br>
  And we will always be<br>
  And I believe in you and me<br>
  And Roy will always be<br><br>

  And I believe in you and me<br>
  And we will always be<br>
  And I believe in you and me<br>
  And Roy will always sing to me
</p>
