<h4>Lyrics</h4>

<p>
  Sometimes I get lost in my head and I can’t get out and I don’t feel like me<br>
  The darkness I feel the pain in the world and I want to be free<br>
  When I feel myself slipping into the eternal pit that low low place<br>
  I think of something that’s pure art that is eternal eternal grace<br><br>

  If your thirsty friend if you need a drink have a tall glass of Thor<br>
  When the world feels too much Chris Hemsworth Abs, Chris Hemsworth Abs<br><br>

  When you’re home alone thinking about it all is there some regret?<br>
  The darkness you feel the pain in the world and you want to be free<br>
  When you feel yourself being a person you don’t to be<br>
  You can’t hug a belief so embrace we and floss regularly<br><br>

  If your thirsty friend if you need a drink have a tall glass of Thor<br>
  When the world feels too much Chris Hemsworth Abs, Chris Hemsworth Abs<br>
  If your thirsty friend if you need a drink have a tall glass of Thor<br>
  When the world feels too much Chris Hemsworth Abs, Chris Hemsworth Abs<br>
  If your thirsty friend if you need a drink have a tall glass of Thor<br>
  When the world feels too much Chris Hemsworth Abs, Chris Hemsworth Abs<br>
  If your thirsty friend if you need a drink have a tall glass of Thor<br>
  When the world feels too much Chris Hemsworth Abs, Chris Hemsworth Abs<br>
