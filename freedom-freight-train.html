<h4>Lyrics</h4>

<p>
  Do you remember the time<br>
  On the stoop you held an invitation<br>
  Accept this board of iron and join a dream<br><br>

  We would go to a kick ass show<br>
  Assimilate the rock and roll<br>
  Yelling at the band to play Nirvana<br><br>

  And I believe in you ooh<br>
  And you believe in me ee<br>
  And we will always be e e e e<br>
  And I believe in you ooh<br>
  And you believe in me ee<br>
  And Roy will always be<br><br>

  Do you remember the time<br>
  A freight train ran off the rails<br>
  My rock and roll brother kept believing in me<br>
  My hand fell from the golden throttle<br>
  Lost the rock and found the bottle<br>
  Stuck in Graceland Roy yearned to be free<br><br>

  And I believe in you ooh<br>
  And you believe in me ee<br>
  And we will always be<br>
  And I believe in you ooh<br>
  And you believe in me ee<br>
  And Roy will always be<br><br>

  And you believe in me ee<br>
  And I believe in you ooh<br>
  And Roy will always be true ooh<br>
  And I believe in you ooh<br>
  And you believe in me ee<br>
  And Roy will always be<br>
  And I believe in you ooh<br>
  And you believe in me ee<br>
  And we will always be<br><br>

  And we will always be…<br>
