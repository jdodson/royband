<h4>Lyrics</h4>

<p>
  Ice age ivory coming for you like knives in the shower<br>
  Is there more to reality than shadows on a wall in a cave<br>
  DNA in a blender<br>
  Can you remember<br>
  A dash of rock mixed in a golden cup of roll<br><br>

  Mammoth Army<br>
  Mammoth Army arise!<br>
  Mammoth Army<br>
  Mammoth Army all rise!<br>

  Nightmares made of muscle and bone advance toward the wall around Graceland<br>
  Terror grows in the vegtable patch<br>
  Of our hearts beating eggs ride the train (ALL ABOARD)<br>
  Machine becomes master<br>
  Crichton warned of disaster<br>
  A dash of rock mixed in a golden cup of roll<br>

  Mammoth Army<br>
  Mammoth Army arise!<br>
  Mammoth Army<br>
  Mammoth Army all rise!<br><br>

  ALL ABOARD<br><br>

  Mammoth Army<br>
  Mammoth Army arise!<br>
  Mammoth Army<br>
  Mammoth Army all rise!<br><br>

  Mammoth Army<br>
  Mammoth Army arise!<br>
  Mammoth Army<br>
  Mammoth Army all rise!
