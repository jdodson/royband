<h4>Lyrics</h4>

<p>
  I like playing Nintendo with Paul<br>
  I love Star Wars because we were Birds<br>
  Bring back the blink tag<br>
  You’ve been cancelled by Roy<br><br>

  I was with God in the beginning of time and the universe<br>
  There was so much screaming there was so much screaming<br><br>

  I like playing Nintendo with Paul<br>
  I love Star Wars because we were Birds<br>
  Bring back the blink tag<br>
  You’ve been cancelled by Roy<br><br>

  Everybody now<br><br>

  I like playing Nintendo with Paul<br>
  I love Star Wars because we were Birds<br>
  Bring back the blink tag<br>
  You’ve been cancelled by Roy
</p>
